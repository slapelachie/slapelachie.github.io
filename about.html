           <h1>About Me</h1>
           <p>
               Hello! My name is Lachlan Slape. I am a programmer, GNU/Linux enthusiast and a full time nerd.
               I have an interest in reading, photography, music and pretty much anything that would keep me entertained.
               As a programmer, I follow many philosophies including: KISS (Keep it simple stupid) and the Unix philosophy of do one thing and do it right.
               As a lot of the things I create are scripts, my main programming language is Python.
               However I do mess around with source code programmed in C for my terminal emulator and window manager.
           </p>
           <p>
               Outside of programming, I have a huge passion for sciences (mainly physics), mathematics, reading books and listening to music.
               I guess my interests in physics and mathematics probably stems from my love in programming, with how I love to learn how things work.
               My taste in music is extremely diverse, with interests from Rock to Classical to J-Pop, depending on what mood I am in.
               I still don't know what I want to do with this website, maybe I will start a blog on it or something.
               As it stands it is purely for business purposes and to be 'professional'.
