                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Lachlan Slape. I am a programmer, GNU/Linux enthusiast and a full time nerd.
                    I have an interest in reading, photography, music and pretty much anything that would keep me entertained.
                    As a programmer, I follow many philosophies including: KISS (Keep it simple stupid) and the Unix philosophy of do one thing and do it right.
                    As a lot of the things I create are scripts, my main programming language is Python.
                    However I do mess around with source code programmed in C for my terminal emulator and window manager.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of programming, I have a huge passion for sciences (mainly physics) and mathematics. 
                    I guess my interests in physics and mathematics probably stems from my love in programming, with how I love to learn the underlying mechanics of everything.
                    I still don't know what I want to do with this website, maybe I will start a blog on it or something.
                    As it stands it is purely for business purposes and to be 'professional'.
                </p>

                <h1>My Projects</h1>
                <h2><a href="https://github.com/slapelachie/kadai">kadai</a></h2>
                <p>
                    kadai - a python progrom - is one of my most polished projects that I have completed.
                    It is a simple yet extensible program that generates color-schemes based on a wallpaper it's given.
                    It's extensible nature allows you to add hooks to the program and update pretty much anything, from your terminal to even gtk-based applications.
                </p>

                <h2><a href="https://github.com/slapelachie/jyou">jyou</a></h2>
                <p>
                    jyou was written to go hand-in-hand with my previous project, kadai.
                    Like kadai, jyou is programmed using python, and features a minimal lockscreen wallpaper generated aimed at people with multiple monitors.
                    It has features including adding blur and darkening the image.
                    jyou shines with it's multiple monitor generation, aimed at programs similar to i3lock that do not place the image per monitor, but instead stretch it over all of them.
                </p>

                <h2><a href="https://github.com/slapelachie/slapelachie.github.io">This Website</a></h2>
                <p>
                    This project is what you are currently viewing, a simple yet functional personal website for myself.
                    I have plans to extend this website in the future once I buy a domain and vps, but for now I'm keeping it as you see.
                    I plan to have these projects automatically added from my git repo, among other features.
